        Optimus Prime Summary
    </h1>
</br>
<p>
    He has appeared in all of Michael Bay's Transformers films as well as the reboot Bumblebee film,
     albeit he is completely redesigned in appearance. He was more of his G1 counterpart. His vehicle mode being a Freightliner fl86. 
     Equipped with his signature ion blaster. Though it may be the only weapon we see in the movie, he does have many more. 
     Along with his ending scene in Bumblebee, Optimus Prime had his trailer like in Transformers.

 
  Following a beacon sent by Bumblebee the previous night, Optimus, Jazz, Ironhide, and Ratchet arrived on Earth in their protoform modes.
   After scanning a Peterbilt semi-truck as his alt mode, Optimus met up with Bumblebee, Ratchet, 
  Jazz, and Ironhide in an alley and explained their history to Sam and Mikaela, as well as Sam's importance.

        After releasing the Dinobots from his command, Optimus prepared to depart into space, to both remove the seed from Earth, and to investigate the mystery of his creators, who still had a price on his head. His innate faith in humanity reignited by Cade and his family and friends, Optimus entreated the humans to think of one of the stars as his soul, and instructed the Autobots to guard the Yeagers, their allies, and all the humans they could.
